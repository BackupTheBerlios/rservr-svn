Resourcerver is a set of libraries and programs used as
the control-communication infrastructure of multi-process
applications.  An instance of an application consists of the
<code>rservr</code> server daemon and the processes that
server binds together.  The server is the starting point of
the application, which in turn spawns each of the
application's component processes, referred to as "clients."

The server daemon regulates the IPC of the application by
enforcing several permission sets.  Each client process must
select a permission set defining what that client's general
purpose is.  These permissions restrict which other types of
client one can communicate with and what actions it can
perform on the server daemon.

<tr><td align="justify">

Client processes communicate with each other using
well-defined data bursts referred to as "commands."  Each
command has creation and execution permissions associate
with it, as well as compiled-in actions that are executed at
the final destination.  The emphasis here is that the IPC
system <i>isn't</i> intended for data transfer; it's
intended for communication to control the operations of the
application as a whole.

<p>Resourcerver has an expandable IPC system to allow
3rd-party command plug-ins.  A plug-in is loaded at run time
by both the originator of the command and the target; by
loading the command, potential targets consent to execution
of the associated commands when they arrive.  The core
system contains several plug-ins, all of which rely on hook
functions to be defined by potential targets.  When the
commands arrive at a target, they execute the hook function,
providing it with the parameters sent with the command.  One
of the more notable examples is a plug-in library to request
networking actions.  A command in that plug-in requests a
target connect to a host; however, the plug-in doesn't
define how this will happen.  The target loading the plug-in
defines how the connection will be made by defining the hook
function.
